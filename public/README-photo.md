# Professional Photo Placeholder

Your professional photo should be placed in the `public` folder as `professional-photo.jpg` to be accessible by the portfolio.

For now, the portfolio uses a placeholder image from Unsplash. To use your actual photo:

1. Save your photo as `professional-photo.jpg` in the `public` folder
2. Update the image source in the SinglePagePortfolio component from the Unsplash URL to `/professional-photo.jpg`

The photo will be displayed in a circular format in the About section of your portfolio.
